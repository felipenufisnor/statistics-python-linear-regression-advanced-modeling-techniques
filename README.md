Linear Regression: advanced modeling techniques

I applied transformations to the data obtained in Kaggle before training my models;
I applied regressions with Statsmodel and Sklearn;
I learned advanced modeling techniques;
I obtained point forecasts and interpreted estimated coefficients; 
Finally, I performed graphical analyzes of the results found.
